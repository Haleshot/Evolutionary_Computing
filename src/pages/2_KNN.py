    ## Overview
    This Python file contains the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. KNN is a simple, easy-to-understand algorithm that classifies a new data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

    ## Contents
    The file consists of the following components:

    1. **Import Statements**: Import necessary libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for numerical computation and data manipulation.

    2. **Utility Functions**: Includes functions for data preprocessing, such as normalization and feature scaling.

    3. **KNN Class Definition**: Defines the KNN class, which encapsulates the functionality of the KNN algorithm. It includes methods for training the model, predicting class labels, and evaluating the model's performance.

    4. **Main Function**: The main function reads the dataset from a file, preprocesses it, trains the KNN model, and evaluates its performance using cross-validation.

    ## Usage
    To use the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, follow these steps:

    1. Ensure that the dataset is formatted correctly and saved in a compatible file format.

    2. Import the KNN class from the provided Python file into your project.

    3. Create an instance of the KNN class and specify the value of k (number of neighbors).

    4. Train the KNN model using the `fit` method, passing the training data and corresponding class labels.

    5. Use the `predict` method to classify new data points based on their feature values.

    6. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    from sklearn import metrics


    def sigmoid(Z):
        '''
        Sigmoid function
        '''
        return 1/(1+np.exp(-Z))


    def KNN():
        # Logic goes here

    ```
