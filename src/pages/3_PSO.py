    ## Overview
    This Python file contains the implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. It is commonly used to find the optimal solution for optimization problems.

    ## Contents
    The file consists of the following components:

    1. **Particle Class Definition**: Defines the Particle class, which represents a single particle in the PSO algorithm. Each particle contains information about its position, velocity, and personal and global best solutions.

    2. **Swarm Class Definition**: Defines the Swarm class, which represents the entire population of particles in the PSO algorithm. It includes methods for initializing the swarm, updating particle positions and velocities, and optimizing the target function.

    3. **Target Function**: Defines the target function to be optimized by the PSO algorithm. This function evaluates the fitness of a particle's position in the search space.

    4. **Main Function**: The main function creates an instance of the Swarm class, initializes the swarm with random particle positions and velocities, and optimizes the target function using the PSO algorithm.

    ## Usage
    To use the PSO algorithm for optimization tasks, follow these steps:

    1. Import the Swarm class from the provided Python file into your project.

    2. Define the target function that you want to optimize.

    3. Create an instance of the Swarm class and specify the number of particles and other parameters.

    4. Initialize the swarm with random particle positions and velocities.

    5. Optimize the target function using the `optimize` method of the Swarm class.

    6. Retrieve the best solution found by the PSO algorithm from the swarm.

    ## Example
    ```python
    def PSO():
        # Logic goes here

    # Create an instance of the Swarm class
    swarm = Swarm()

    # Initialize the swarm with random particle positions and velocities
    swarm.initialize_swarm()

    # Optimize the target function using the PSO algorithm
    best_solution = swarm.optimize(target_function)

    # Print the best solution found by the PSO algorithm
    print("Best Solution:", best_solution)
